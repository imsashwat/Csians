# Csians - a student resource portal

we students, go through a lot of hussle as there was no one stop solution to get real time info
of day to day college precedings so, I have tried to make a small difference in students lives 
and have made a basic web app that has real time information of all the day to day activities 
related to studentâ€™s college life.
